It’s been 99 years since an total eclipse crossed the width the United States.
This year, the 65-mile wide path of totality with sweep, sash-like, across
the country—entering the map at Oregon and exiting at South Carolina.
The once-in-a-lifetime spectacle will attract an estimated 7.4 million
people to areas in the path of totality, including so-called eclipse-chasers, 
who plan for years in advance and travel from far and wide to get a glimpse of the stellar phenomenon.
No matter where you are in the country, if you plan to look at or even
toward the sun, be sure to protect your eyes. According to experts, 
only those in the path of totality are safe to look at the eclipse without 
protection, and only during totality.
